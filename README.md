 Blinkit Data Analysis Project
This project presents an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Blinkitâ€™s operational dataset, focusing on performance metrics, sales trends, and business-relevant insights. The goal is to assist Blinkit in making data-driven decisions around product assortment, outlet performance, and customer preferences.

ðŸ§¹ 1. Data Cleaning
The raw dataset undergoes structured cleaning:

Handling missing values and duplicates

Standardizing categorical labels (e.g., Fat Content, Outlet Size)

Correcting data types and removing anomalies

ðŸŽ¯ 2. Business Requirements
This section maps the analysis to practical business questions such as:

Which item types drive the most revenue?

How do sales vary by outlet size and location?

Are certain fat content products more profitable?

What role does outlet establishment year play in performance?

ðŸ“Š 3. Key Visual Insights
Several visualizations help answer the business questions:

Total Sales by Fat Content

Sales Distribution by Item Type

Fat Content by Outlet vs. Sales

Outlet Establishment Year vs. Total Sales

Sales by Outlet Size and Location

Each chart reveals relationships and patterns that could guide inventory planning, outlet expansion, and marketing strategies.

ðŸ§° 4. Tools & Libraries Used
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations


ðŸ“Œ Summary
The Blinkit analysis notebook not only uncovers key performance indicators (KPIs) but also links data-driven results to actionable business recommendations. It demonstrates how structured EDA can bridge the gap between raw data and strategic decisions in a hyperlocal delivery ecosystem.
